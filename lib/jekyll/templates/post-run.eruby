Your new Jekyll site <%= @gen.camelname %> has been created

<% if @gen.renamed %>
(Note that '<%= @gen.filename %>' has been changed to '<%= @gen.wormname %>' because Ruby finds '-'s troubling)

<% end %>
Now do

    cd <%= @gen.wormname %>
    bundle
    bundle exec jekyll

which will launch the site (at http://localhost:4000)

And presuming that works OK

    git add .
    git commit -m 'First commit'

You should also fill in your name in LICENSE.md
