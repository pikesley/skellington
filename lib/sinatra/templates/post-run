Your new Sinatra app <%= @gen.camelname %> has been created

<% if @gen.renamed %>
(Note that '<%= @gen.filename %>' has been changed to '<%= @gen.wormname %>' because Ruby finds '-'s troubling)

<% end %>
Now do

    cd <%= @gen.wormname %>
    bundle
    bundle exec rake

And presuming that passes OK

    git add .
    git commit -m 'First commit'

Then try (in 2 different windows)

    bundle exec rake run:sass
    bundle exec rake run:app

which will launch Compass and then run the app (at http://localhost:9292)
<% unless @gen.licensor %>

You should also fill in your name in LICENSE.md
<% end %>
